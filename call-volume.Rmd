According to the US Census Bureau the population in the city of Denver has a growth rate of  1.6\% per year and the city has grown by just under 20\% since 2010. As a natural consequence of this growth there has also been a steady increase in EMS calls.  

```{r call-by-year}

```

This growth in call volume will lead to an increased need for emergency medical personnel and the need to place that personnel in a proper schedule.  There are clear trends in the volume of EMS calls by hour of the day and day of the week.
